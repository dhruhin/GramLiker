Installation Guide:

0. If you don't have PhantomJS, the required framework, install that first.
  a. I installed this on my Mac and this is how I did it.
  Paste the following into Terminal to get brew, a package manager for Mac:
  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  
  Paste the following into Terminal to install PhantomJS through brew:
  brew install phantomjs
1. Run the program by typing "./insta.sh username password"
  a. Don't forget to populate "handles.txt" with all the Instagram handles you want to like the 3 recent pictures of.
  Always press return after the last handle (bash needs this).
Ex:
@nike
@nba
(Empty line, don't actually type this, insert an empty line after)

Only 1 step? Yeah, it's that simple.
